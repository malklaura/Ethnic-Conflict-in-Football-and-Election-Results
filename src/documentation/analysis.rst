Scatter ethnicity vs. card score
=================================

The code in *src.analysis.scatter_ethnicity_card_score* produces binned scatter plots of ethnicity vs. card score across all games in *bld.out.data.football_files.games_final.csv*. The card score is computed by summing up the measures for yellow and red cards. The resulting figures are stored in *bld.out.figures*.
